You need Python 3.8 or newer installed on your device. Check if you already have it installed before you install:

On Windows, open command prompt, type `dir %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Python` and hit enter
On Mac, open terminal, type `python -V` and hit enter
On Linux, open terminal, type `ll /usr/bin/python*` and hit enter

If you do not see `python 3.8*+`, then you do not have it installed and need to do so from `python.org`.
